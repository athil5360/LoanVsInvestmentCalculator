### 🎯 EMI + Invest Strategy

- Invest remaining monthly savings from day one
- After loan completion, redirect full amount (EMI + savings) to investments
- Benefit from **early compounding** of investments

### 🚀 Debt-First Strategy
- Use your **entire savings** to repay the loan faster
- Once the loan is paid off, invest the full amount (EMI + savings)
- Minimize interest burden and become **debt-free early**
